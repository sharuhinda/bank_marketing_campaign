WEEK 9 (02.01.2023)

3. Data Cleansing and Transformation

Submit a pdf document and ipynb notebook which should contain following details:

Team member's details : Group Name (give a name to your group), Name, Email, Country, College/Company, Specialization ( Data Science, NLP, Data Analyst)

Problem description

Github Repo link

Data cleansing and transformation done on the data.

Try at least 2 techniques to clean the data ( for NA values : mean/median/mode/Model based approach to handle NA value/WOE and like this try different techniques to identify and handle outliers as well)

for NLP try different featurization technique and also clean the data using regex and python

Each member should code and review peers work. (Review comment should be present in the github repo)

Each team member should work on different data cleansing approach.

Note:

If one team member is using mean to impute values then other member should experiment on segmented approach or any other model based approach to impute the null values.

you are allowed to merge the code of each individual and work together to get good result.

Make sure code of each team member is placed at provided URL (single repository for whole team).

=================================

WEEK 10 (09.01.2023)

Submit a pdf document and EDA ipynb file which should contain following details:

EDA presentation for business users

Last slide of EDA should be dedicated to technical user which should contain recommended models for this data set.

=================================

WEEK 12 (23.01.2023)

Select your base model and then explore 1 model of each family if its classification problem then 1 model for Linear models, 1- Model for Ensemble, 1-Model for boosting and other models if you have time (like stacking)

 

Please make sure selected model fits in your business requirement. For example : If your business does not want black box model then select only those models which can be used to explain the prediction.

As this is group assignment hence upload the code of each team member and other deliverables in the single repo and share the URL of that repo.

 Interns of Data analysis Project should submit dashboard in this week. 

you are allowed to merge the code of each individual and work together to get good result.

=================================

WEEK 13 (30.01.2023)

Provide the link of your code and report.

 

As it was group assignment hence go far a call with your team and discuss the solution of each member and

select that solution which is best and is per the requirement.

Power point presentation is must.

you are allowed to merge the code of each individual and work together to get good result.
